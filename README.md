## Installation

1.  **Install the Kijai Custom Node:**
    *   Clone the KijaiÂ´s [ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper) repository into your ComfyUI's `custom_nodes` directory.  Alternatively, install it through the ComfyUI Manager.

2.  **Node File Replacement:**
    *   **Important:**  In your `ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper` folder, rename the existing `nodes.py` file to `nodes.py_` (or any other name).  This ensures it's not overwritten.
    *   Copy the `nodes.py` file from *this* repository (the one you're viewing) and paste it into your `ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper` folder.

3.  **Workflow:**
    *   Download the provided workflow.
    *   Load the workflow into ComfyUI and start generating videos!
